# crud - Create, read, update and delete

A typical CRUD implementation allows the user or admin to create, read, update and delete data and will typically be used for any systems relying on dynamic data.

## Must-have features

As a kid, maybe you were collecting things. Sea shells, Pokemon cards, stamps, ... With Pokemon being popular again, it can be interesting to build a site to make an inventory of your collection.

ðŸ’¡ There's a lot to forms: validation, styling or retaining data when validation fails. Doing all this can be time consuming, so focus any the logic first for this exercise.

## Preparation

- [x] Think of a collection you'd like to have an inventory for: Birds
- [x] What information is interesting to keep track of for that kind of objects? Common Name, Scientific Name, Local Name, Location Name, Longitude, Latitude, etc ... images,
- [ ] Prepare the database structure to contain this info, and add some quick dummy content
- [ ] Have a look at the provided structure (make as much use of it as you can, it will pay off later)

## Step 1: read

- [ ] On the overview page, build an overview of everything in the collection (you will find some provided code that's helpful for this)

## Step 2: create

- [ ] Build a form that contains all the relevant fields
- [ ] Once the form is submitted, save this info as a new entry in the database
- [ ] In a real application, you'd validate all of the data. In this case it's optional: focus on the database parts first

## Step 3: update

- [ ] Make a new page edit.php
- [ ] When clicking on an edit link for an entry, the edit page is loaded for that specific item
- [ ] When the edit form is submitted, the relevant entry in the database is updated

## Step 4: delete

- [ ] Build a link to delete.php that will delete a specific product from the database
      Afterwards, it will redirect to the overview

## Bonus rounds:

- [ ] Check who might need your help. Maybe your discoveries can already prove valuable to your peers?
- [ ] Pair up with someone: what difference do you have in your approach? Discuss and look for opportunities to further improve your code.
- [ ] Once an item is clicked, a detail page is loaded (called show.php, no styling needed). What PHP technique can you use to specify the id of that product on the detail page?
- [ ] So everything works for the good guys? Nice! What if the bad guys discover your site too...? Read up on SQL injection and protect your code against it.
- [ ] What interesting data can you include for your collection: images or fetch some stuff from an API - found something? Go for it!
